# How to develop and run microservices on IBM Cloud?

This one day workshop has three major sections.

* Build and deploy your first Java microservice to Kubernetes on IBM Cloud
* Let’s get started with a cloud native microservice application on Kubernetes with Istio
* Build and deploy a Java microservices to OpenShift


## 1. [Build and deploy your first Java microservice to Kubernetes on IBM Cloud](./workshop-full-day/1-Build-and-deploy-your-first-Java-microservice-to-Kubernetes) (60 - 90 min)

This workshop demonstrates how to build a microservice with Java and how to deploy it to Kubernetes on the IBM Cloud.

The microservice is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other microservices. The microservice has been developed with Java EE and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

## 2. Let’s get started with a cloud native microservice application on Kubernetes and Istio (90 min)

In this hands-workshop we do address the question: 

> How to start with **cloud native Java applications** in Kubernetes?

We will cover the following major topics and we learn along the given **source code** and **bash scripts** inside this end-to-end microservices example cloud-native-starter project:

* Java development with [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) 
* [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)
* [Containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualisation)
* [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* [Traffic management](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/) 
* [Resiliency](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/resiliency)
 
## 3. Deploy a Java Microservices to OpenShift on IBM Cloud (60 - 90 min)

This workshop demonstrates how to build a microservice with Java and how to deploy it to OpenShift.

The microservice is kept as simple as possible, so that it can be used as a starting point for other microservices. The microservice has been developed with Java EE and [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).

There are [various ways to deploy applications to OpenShift](http://heidloff.net/article/deploying-open-liberty-microservices-openshift/). The options have different advantages and disadvantages which are explained in the following labs.
