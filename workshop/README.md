# Letâ€™s get started with cloud native Java applications on Kubernetes

In this hands-workshop we do address the question: 

> How to start with **cloud native Java applications** in Kubernetes?

We will cover the following major topics and we learn along the given **source code** and **bash scripts** inside this end-to-end microservices example cloud-native-starter project:

* Java development with [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) 
* [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes)
* [Containers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualisation)
* [REST APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* [Traffic management](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/traffic-management/) 
* [Resiliency](https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/capabilities/resiliency)
